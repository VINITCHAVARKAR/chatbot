Chatbot helpdesk.

In this project, I developed a Python web application using the Flask framework. The purpose of the application is to serve as a helpdesk, specifically focusing on health conditions and their severity. To accomplish this, I integrated the ChatGPT API as the NLP engine.

The web app features two dropdown menus. The first dropdown allows users to select a health condition from a predefined list. The second dropdown enables users to indicate the severity of the chosen condition. After selecting the condition and severity, users can engage in a chat conversation with the chatbot.

Behind the scenes, the Flask application communicates with the ChatGPT API to process and generate responses based on the provided condition and severity. The API's NLP capabilities allow the chatbot to understand user queries and provide relevant and informative responses.

Overall, this project provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to seek help regarding various health conditions and their severity levels. The integration of the ChatGPT API enhances the chatbot's intelligence, enabling it to effectively assist users and provide accurate information based on the specified condition and severity.
